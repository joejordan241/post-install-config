Since tickets are routed through Departments in the help desk, there are many settings that can be set for each Department. The above image will show the many different settings.In this step you can also configure Teams and Roles.

Help Topics will help streamline your end-userâ€™s help desk experience to ensure proper assignment and prompt response to the ticket. In the image above it shows that you can create as many Help Topics as needed and can even nest Help Topics within each other for further breakdown (For example, Human Resources and Human Resources/Payroll.)
